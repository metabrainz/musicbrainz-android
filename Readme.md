## What Is MusicBrainz?
<li>The ultimate source of music information by allowing anyone to contribute and releasing the data under open licenses.</li>
    <li>The universal lingua franca for music by providing a reliable and unambiguous form of music identification, enabling both people and machines to have meaningful conversations about music.</li>
    <br>
    Like Wikipedia, MusicBrainz is maintained by a global community of users and we want everyone, including you, to participate and contribute.

## What Is Musicbrainz Android For?
MusicBrainz is designed to do the following:

<li> View release information by scanning a barcode</li>
<li> Search for information about artists, releases, release groups, labels, recordings, instruments, and events.</li>
<li> View collections</li>
<li> Send Releases to your Picard</li>
<li> Donate to the MetaBrainz Foundation via PayPal</li>

## How does MusicBrainz Do This?

MusicBrainz captures information about artists, their recorded works, and the relationships between them. Recorded works entries capture at a minimum the album title, track titles, and the length of each track. These entries are maintained by volunteer editors who follow community written style guidelines. Recorded works can also store information about the release date and country, the CD ID, cover art, acoustic fingerprint, free-form annotation text, and other metadata. As of September 2020, MusicBrainz contained information on roughly 1.7 million artists, 2.6 million releases, and 23 million recordings. End-users can use software that communicates with MusicBrainz to add metadata tags to their digital media files, such as ALAC, FLAC, MP3, Ogg Vorbis, or AAC.
